**Handwritten Digit Classification with Keras & TensorFlow**

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a neural network using Keras (with TensorFlow backend) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0â€“9), each of size 28Ã—28 pixels. The task is to correctly classify each image into one of the 10 digit categories.

ðŸš€ Features

Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset.

Builds a deep neural network using Keras Sequential API.

Trains the model on training data with validation.

Evaluates accuracy on the test set.

Provides visualization of predictions
